## What?
Get Some REST is a simple, yet powerful, package that integrates into your Laravel 5 project.
It provides some structure to help you get started on your restful API with just some basic setup.
The best part of this is that you can extend or modify the core of the system, using an implementation of your own liking.

## Installation
So let's get started on the installation.
As said, it integrates into your Laravel 5 project by adding it to your composer.json

```json
{
    "require": {
        "peakfijn/get-some-rest": "dev-release/v0.5.0-rc.3"
    }
}
```

Or execute the following command inside your laravel 5 project.

```sh
composer require peakfijn/get-some-rest:dev-release/v0.5.0-rc.3
```

### Note
Get Some REST is currently in intensive development, meaning it is **not ready for production... _yet_...**

## Requirements
This package will work just fine with the following requirements:

- **PHP 5.4+**
- **Laravel 5+**
